# TutrTrade
Built by Arjun Sarao & Connor Wilson

## Inspiration
With the shift to online learning models, accessing homework help has been severely impacted. Getting help on a question or two by asking a classmate has become a challenge. While websites like Chegg or Course Hero exist, they are paid, which seems unreasonable to average students. We created an app that used in-house currency that can be earned by answering questions. 

## What it does
TutrTrade is a peer-to-peer tutoring app that lets people post requests for question completion or tutoring sessions. People can then take these requests, once a teacher and student have been connected, we set up a texting channel between the two and they solve the problem. Once the goal or solution has been reached, the student can then end the session and rate the tutor. Concurrently, coins are deposited from the students account to the teachers.

## How we built it
We started by looking for inspiration on dribble, after we had compiled a board of reference images. We started to create mockups on Adobe XD. Once that was completed we started the arduous process of recreating it in flutter. Finally, we created a framework on cloud firebase that would let us manage userdata (name, email, chat logs, etc.).

## Challenges we ran into
* Figuring out a design philosophy
* Getting  firebase working
* Getting texting to work
* Customising the layout to match with the mockups

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Being able to create a workable app in only 24 hours.
* Getting Firebase to work
* Building a messaging system from scratch

## What we learned
* Getting live updates from firebase
* Making mockups in Adobe XD
* More advanced flutter concepts

## What's next for TutrTrade
* Making the UI even better
* Promoting the app to the community
* Being able to sort requests by topic
* Optimizing the requests page
* Add voice and video call options to the tutoring.
* Other gamification strategies?
* Make notifications and popups for various events
